//
// Purpose:	A COMBOROW is a data type designed to hold the four values 
//		necessary to describe a four-in-a-row or equivalently a set of
//	points necessary to win.  This file describes how this data type
//	interacts.  
//
//	Perhaps the most important function on a combo row is cr_register().
//	This function registers that someone has moved, possibly into the row,
//	and adjusts the row accordingly.
