// Filename: 	strategy.c
//
// Project:	tttt, a simple 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe Program
//
// Purpose:	Here's the "strategy" defining how the computer makes its
//		decisions.  The strategy is the result of a lot of work
//	trying to build a brute-force algorithm for 4x4x4 tic-tac-toe, only
//	to come to the slow realization that brute-forcing something with
//	nearly 64! possibilities just ... isn't going to happen in my lifetime.
//	Hence, the result is a rule-based strategy.  Because it is rule based,
//	it is neither perfect nor unbeatable.  However, it is both very
//	effective, as well as computationally light and fast.
//
//	Basically, each rule is a function that returns a VSET.  The strategy
//	is nothing more than a table of functions/rules.  Rules are done in
//	priority order.  The result must lie within the set created by the 
//	first rule.  Subsequent rules are used only if their results intersect
//	with the first sets results.
//
//	Difficulty is determined by the set of rules in play.  If all rules are
//	in play, the difficulty is maximized.
